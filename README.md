# covid-model

This dataset explores the research parameters that affect a person's need for hospitalisation and analyses information on COVID patients. The dataset includes blood oxygen levels, respiratory issues (yes/no), pre-existing chronic conditions, body temperature, and age of the patient. In weighing all these attributes in determining the best predictors for important outcomes of COVID-19 around "Need Hospitalisation" (yes/no), we consider these factors. We also check for the correlations between the ageing process and the occurrence of chronic diseases and decrease in blood oxygen levels. The correlation between being respiratory compromised and the need for hospitalisation is also evaluated considering the interaction with other factors. The final verification of the importance of each specified risk factor is assessed through various statistical analyses.

Results of the study are expected to help improve risk categorisation of COVID-19 patients, which will aid in appropriate utilization of healthcare resources and improved patient outcomes. By identifying high-risk patients based on these easily available factors, healthcare workers can focus on treatment and interventions for those patients needing hospitalisation.
